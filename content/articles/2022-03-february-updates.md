February has been a relatively slow month for poliastro,
since both Juan Luis and Jorge have ramping up their respective new jobs.

Despite of that, Juan Luis [published poliastro 0.16.2](https://docs.poliastro.space/en/0.16.x/changelog.html#poliastro-0-16-2-2022-02-10),
a new version with significant documentation improvements
and a bunch of bug fixes.
